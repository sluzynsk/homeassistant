These are my Home Assistant configs. Enjoy.

Current bits of interest:
1. Ring integration for camera
2. Multiple ESPHome based temp/humidity sensors
3. Sonos integrations
4. Plant monitor in the office
5. Hunter-Douglas Powerview scene integration (mostly working)
6. ZWave via MQTT because the build in zwave stuff sucks
7. Alarm.com arm/disarm/status support
8. Automated backups to GDrive
9. Node-RED automations for lights
10. Tasmota panel - lists firmware versions and IP addresses currently

To-dos:
1. More ESPHomes once I get my 3d printer fixed
2. Set up AppDaemon dashboard for tablets
3. Finish Tasmota panel to add firmware updating
