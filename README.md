These are my Home Assistant configs. Enjoy.

Current bits of interest:
1. Ring integration for camera
2. Multiple ESPHome based temp/humidity sensors
3. Sonos integrations
4. Plant monitor in the office
5. Hunter-Douglas Powerview scene integration (mostly working)
6. ZWave is garbage but it's there
7. Alarm.com arm/disarm/status support
8. Automated backups to GDrive
9. Node-RED automations for lights

To-dos:

2. Figure out how to make Zwave not suck
3. Sonoff 433MHz bridge integration once it arrives from China
4. Set up 433MHz remotes with Sonoff bridge once they arrive from China
5. Make it look nicer
6. Set up AppDaemon dashboard for tablets
